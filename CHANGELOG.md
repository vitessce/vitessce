- Fixed a small bug with the path configuration for the `obsSets` component when using zero config mode.
- Add notes about branch naming conventions and pull request merge process to README
- Added bidirectional interactions for the `CellSetSizesPlot` vega-lite plot to allow the Vitessce view to update and show the selected cluster on bar click.
- Implemented a "select-only" option for the `CellSetSizesPlot` on shift+click. 
- Implemented ability to select a gene by clicking on the heatmap rows for a given gene.
- Added developer troubleshooting instructions to README.
- Add `useFullResolutionImage` to `Spatial` to allow for loading only full resolution image from pyramid.
- Implemented ability to select an area on the Expression Histogram. On select, a new obs set selection is created. The new selection contains the ids of all obs that belong to the selected bars.
- Add integration test for consumer site built with NextJS.
- Implemented ability to show two columns in the feature-list view when each feature has a second identifer associated.
- Add `CITATION.cff`
- Added a button to recenter and rescale data to default for Scatterplot and Spatial views.

### Changed
- Fix hot module reloading by refactoring JS files that export React components (the component needs to be the only export for HMR to work). Add react-refresh eslint plugin to check for this moving forward.
- Fixes Go to Definition support in vscode (see https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/49003#issuecomment-1164659854).
- Refactor `obsFeatureMatrix` normalization logic out of data loader classes and into custom hooks that can be used in view implementations as-needed.
- Fixed syntax highlighting for code examples and editor in documentation.
- Added a new file `VitessceAutoConfig.js` with methods and classes that can generate view config, given a list of dataset URLs.
- Added a new documentation page: `default-config.md` that describes the auto config generation functionality and how to use it.
- Small changes to the layout of `_ViewConfigEditor.js` to accomodate the new functionality: added a space for pasting links and a "Generate Config" button.
- Update Vitest configuration to only include test files contained within `src` directories.
- Added signals tracking and handling in the vega-lite schema for `CellSetSizesPlot` component.
- Modified the `treeToSetSizesBySetNames` function to return the `setNamePath`, so we can track which hierarchy the cluster represented by the clicked bar belongs to.
- Modified the `CellSetSizesPlotSubscriber` component to reset `cellSetSelection` to equal `setNamePath` when user clicks on a bar in the `CellSetSizesPlot` component.
- Changed `VegaPlot.js` to accept prop called `setName` and overwrite the default tooltip style of vega-tooltip.
- Added a new `styles.js` file that defines the style of the vega-tooltips.
- Changed `CellSetSizesPlot.js` and `CellSetExpressionPlot.js` to pass in `setName` as props when calling `VegaPlot`.
- Added more complex logic in `CellSetSizesPlotSubscriber.js` to determine which bars should be displayed in `CellSetSizesPlot.js`.
- Added a new `set-path-utils` file with the functions containing the more complex logic around choosing which hierarchy to display on the `CellSetSizesPlot`.
- Added one more prop under `data` in `CellSetSizesPlot`, called `isGrayedOut` and made vega-lite to color in gray bars where this property is set to true.
- Added `obsSetExpansion` to coordination scope and started using it in `CellSetSizesPlotSubscriber.js`.
- Added handling for the `onClick` function in the `Heatmap` component. The `Heatmap` component calls the `onHeatmapClick` function, defined in the `HeatmapSubscriber`, every time a user clicks on the heatmap. The `onHeatmapClick` function sets the currently selected gene to be equal to the gene the user clicked at. It also sets the cell color encoding to `geneSelection`.
- Upgrade `Viv` to `0.13.7`
- Fix physical size scaling for non-square 2D pixels.
- Removes logic for `tsconfig.json` from the meta-updater script

  - Added ADDITIONAL_OBS_SETS, OBS_SET_COLOR, OBS_COLOR_ENCODING and OBS_SET_SELECTION coordination types to the Feature Histogram.
  - Added a new function called `onSelect`, passed as props to `ExpressionHistogram`. On selection on `ExpressionHistogram`, the function computes what cell ids belong to that selection. Then calls the pre-existing `setObsSelection` function to create a new cell set with the cell ids.
- Added a signal to `ExpressionHistogram` component, which calls `onSelect`, after 1 minute of debounce.
- Replace Ajv with Zod.
  - Add generic config schema.
  - Add builder function for generating plugin-specific config schema.

- Revert change that removed `airbnb` eslint config.
- Only set `additionalObsSets` in coordination space when upgrade was necessary to prevent infinite loop.
- Fix bug causing cell set hierarchy created via `Create hierarchy` button to contain the string `undefined` (e.g., `My hierarchy 1undefined`)
- Fix bug in `CellSetSizesPlotSubscriber` causing page to crash when no `obsSets` view is present (due to expectation of initialized `obsSetSelection` and `obsSetExpansion` coordination values).
- Fix bug causing incorrect gene selection upon heatmap click when `featureLabels` are used (such as in the case of gene aliases used in the HuBMAP data portal view configs).
- Added a new prop to `FeatureListSubscriber` to read in `showTable`, having it false by default.
- Modified the `FeatureList` component to pass in 2 columns and 2 column labels if `showTable` is true, otherwise just 1 column and 1 columnLabel if `showTable` is false.
- Modified the `SelectableTable` component and the table styles to handle showing 2 cells per row.
- Use `es2019` in Vite bundle targets for `packages/main/prod` and `packages/main/dev` to support HuBMAP portal-ui.

  - Added an implementation of that function in `Spatial` and `Scatterplot`.
  - The function is passed to `ToolMenu` as prop by `AbstractSpatialOrScatterplot` and called on click.
- Removed the `select rectangle` tool and all references to it.
- Added a state variable called `originalViewState` in `SpatialSubscriber` and `EmbeddingScatterplotSubscriber`.
  - `originalViewState` holds the value of the initial position of the view and is used for recentering.
- Fix bug preventing correct view sizing upon `config` prop change when `<Vitessce/>` used as a controlled component.
- Modified `HeatmapOptions`, `SpatialOptions` and `ScatterplotOptions` components - added a checkbox for making the tooltip not visible.
- Added a `tooltipsVisible` to the coordination scope for `Heatmap`, `Spatial` and `Scatterplot` coordination types. Its default value is true. Modified the components to hide the tooltip if `tooltipVsisible` is false.
- Removed `disableTooltip` from `props`.
- Fix bug that may cause `originalViewState.target` to not be an array as expected.
- Adjust the code in `onHover` in `Heatmap.js` to track cell position also for cells that are on the cell set bar.
- Add function `useGetObsMembership` in `hooks.js` to get the full path of the cell that was clicked.
- Adjusted the `onHeatmapClick` function in `HeatmapSubscriber.js` to distinguish between clicks on the heatmap and clicks on the cell set bar and take according actions.
- Added a prop `sort` in `FeatureListSubscriber`, with default value equal to `alphabetical`.
- Modified component `FeatureList` so that if sort is not equal to `alphabetical`, then sorting of data is skipped and the order of feature listis the same as original.
- Fixed equality check when creating default model matrices for `sizes`
- Split useEffect into useMemo + useEffect in SpatialSubscriber to fix infinite loop for `neumann-2020` demo on the docs site.
- Delay computing the initial view state longer in EmbeddingScatterplotSubscriber to ensure the view width/height is finished animating.
- Made the cursor type to `pointer` when the user is hovering over the heatmap.
- Fixed a bug in `CellSetSizesPlotSubscriber` plot causing rending of empty `CellSetSizesPlot` when there is no `obsSets` view (due to expectation of initialised `cellSetExpanded` coordination value).
- Created `FeatureListOptions` component, which allows the user to change the sorting order of the feature list.

## [1.1.12](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.1.12) - 2021-07-20

### Added
- Attach on load callbacks and loading indicators to layer controller when using (global) selection slider.
- Added a new view config version `1.0.2` with corresponding upgrade function to fix backwards compatibility of the layer controller. The upgrade function sets the prop `globalDisable3d` for any layer controller components to keep the previous 2D-only functionality that older view configs would expect.

### Changed
- Change bitmask rendering to only display a unique pixel value instead of blending.
- Use component height for determining 3D sizing.
  - Use state rather than computing every render.
- Fix cell highlight bug with bitmask where tooltip information remains on screen after no longer highlighting.
- No selection of cells in bitmask now results in default "grey" color instead of the last selected cell set.
- Cache computation of internal data structures on `AnnData` zarr loaders.
- Upgrade zarr.js to 0.4.0
- Make getting node size efficient by using `reduce` instead of `length`.
- Fixed backwards-compatibility `spatialRasterLayers` bugs:
    - The layer `type` should not be used, since it is currently expected to be either `"raster"` or `"bitmask"`, but previously was allowed to be any string including `"t"`. Instead, need to detect whether the layer is a bitmask layer using `layerMeta.metadata.isBitmask` defined in the `raster.json` file definition.
    - The `visible` property was previously only available for channels. Now, there is a per-layer `visible` property, but old view configs may not contain this. Therefore, we need to explicitly check that the value is a boolean rather than simply falsy `undefined` or `null`.
    - Enforce `type` of `spatialRasterLayers` layer as `bitmask` or `raster`.

## [1.1.11](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.1.11) - 2021-06-25

    - Update UI for `LayerController`
- Global visbiility prop per layer in `spatialRasterLayers`.
- Add indication to Y axis title of cell set expression violin plot when log-transformation is active.

### Changed
- Cache cell set polygon outputs and do not calculate them unless requested.
  - Modify the cache to use an array of tuples, since using an array as an object key results in conversion to string.
- Clean up `getFlatArrDecompressed` fetching.
- Fix bitmask remove button style.
- Offsets error message gives the URL that failed, and the HTTP status.
- Don't show 3D dropdown if only 2D is available.
- Don't show Volume tab (or any tabs) when 3D is not available.

## [1.1.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.1.1) - 2020-12-27

### Added
- Implemented the view config API in JavaScript in a class called `VitessceConfig`.
- Add searchable genes list.
- Support loading AnnData from zarr.
- Added scatterplot component options pane.
- Added a `TextLayer` to render cell set names over the corresponding cell set centroid in the scatterplot.
- Added a gene expression histogram Vega-Lite component and a cell set by gene expression violin plot Vega component.

### Changed
- Genes list is now a virtual scroll to allow for more performant rendering.
- Fix molecules highlight reversion - hovered molecules now appear in the status component.
- Remove "Add Channel" button for RGB images.
- Lazy load HiGlass (and PIXI.js) from absolute URLs (unpkg) to avoid dynamic script import issues with relative paths after bundling.
    - When loading JS resources for HiGlass and PIXI.js, use the current environment (dev/prod) to determine `min.js` vs `js` extensions, and use `package.json` to determine package versions.
- Make ability to do cell set operations (union, intersection, complement) less restrictive
- Implemented the `genomicZoomX`, `genomicZoomY`, `genomicTargetX`, and `genomicTargetY` coordination types for coordinating the zoom and pan interactions of multiple HiGlass views.
    - Simplified the `hgViewConfig` prop so that it supports only a single HiGlass view, and then allows Vitessce to handle the HiGlass view's `initialXDomain` and `initialYDomain` properties (through the coordination space), as well as the rest of the view config.
    - Added the `genomicProfiles` component which abstracts away the HiGlass view config.

## [1.1.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.1.0) - 2020-11-17

### Added
- Built-in support for encoding and decoding compressed conf as url param.
- Add heatmap controls state to saved view config.
- Add `spatialLayers` validation to config schema.
- Add heatmap support to schema.
- `domainType` is now part of the raster spatial layers.
- `domain` is now removed from raster spatial layer channel definition schema, since channel-level domain settings could conflict with layer-level domain _type_ settings.

### Changed
- Fixed schema validity as state updates.
    - Expanded schema to allow null values which denote that these values can be auto-initialized.
        - Note that we do not want the empty array to denote anything special.
- For demos, added a `&debug=true` GET parameter option, to enable logging and validating the published view config on every change.
- Updated cell set functionality to support exporting state via view config:
    - Added the `additionalCellSets` coordination type to store user-defined cell sets
    - Added the `cellSetColor` coordination type to store mappings from cell set paths to cell set colors (for both user-defined and dataset-defined cell sets).
    - Updated the code to avoid reliance on uuid "key" variables. Instead, we want to always use the "name path": the array of strings representing the path down the hierarchy to the node.

- Fix `additionalCellSets` having a tree without a version number.
- Update Viv reference

## [1.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.0.0) - 2020-09-2

### Added
- Introduced a [zustand](https://github.com/react-spring/zustand) store for managing the view config:
    - coordination space
    - layout
        - component-level coordination scopes
- Introduced a provider component: `DatasetLoaderProvider`.
    - `DatasetLoaderProvider` sets up Loader objects for each file of each dataset in the view config.
    - `VitessceGrid` is a consumer of `DatasetLoaderProvider` and injects the mapping from datasets-to-loaders into the child `___Subscriber` components. This functionality replaces the `SourcePublisher` component.
        - The loading spinner was moved into a new `LoadingIndicator` component.
        - Added a new prop `isReady` for the `TitleInfo` component (parent of the `LoadingIndicator` component), so that each `___Subscriber` component can handle its own loading spinner.
- Added a required `version` property to the view config schema.
- Added the `initStrategy` property to the `v1.0.0` view config schema, where the value can be one of `"auto"` or `"none"` (and potentially other things in the future).
    - This will determine how the coordination space is initialized.
    - `"auto"` results in certain coordination types having "global" coordination (all components map to same scope) while the remaining coordination types have "independent" coordination (all components map to different scopes).
        - The `"auto"` strategy also respects any initial coordination setup, and only fills in missing values.
- Added support for both `v0.1.0` ("legacy") and `v1.0.0` (coordination model) view configs via an `upgrade()` function.
    - `v0.1.0` view configs will be validated against the `v0.1.0` schema, then upgraded, and then validated again against the `v1.0.0` schema.
- Added a unique name constraint for cell set names.
    - Because `cellSetSelection` is now a coordination type, the value must be stored in the view config. Previously, multiple cell sets were allowed to exist with the same name because cell sets were identified with a random uuid key internally. We would not want a random uuid key to "leak" into the global state or view config, and instead want to use an externally-meaningful name when identifying cell sets in the view config.
    - Due to this constraint, the automatic naming for cell selections as `"Current selection"` (or `"Current union"`, `"Current intersection"`, `"Current complement"`) have been changed to `"Selection {i}"` (or `"Union {i}"`, `"Intersection {i}"`, `"Complement {i}"`) where `{i}` is the next integer that does not cause a conflict.
- Added the optional `onConfigChange` and `onLoaderChange` callback props to the `Vitessce` component.
    - These allow a consumer app to be notified of all view config (and by extension coordination object) updates.

### Changed
- Update README screenshots.
- Fixed bug in `Status` component in which `cellHighlight` and `geneHighlight` were incorrectly expected to be objects.
- Moved the `Vitessce` component out of `src/app/app.js` into `src/app/Vitessce.js`.
- Moved the `Warning` component out of `src/app/app.js` into `src/app/Warning.js`.
- Renamed `VitessceGrid` to `VitessceGridLayout`.
- Renamed `PubSubVitessceGrid` to `VitessceGrid`.
- Moved utility functions that are common to both `src/components/` and `src/app/` to a new `src/utils.js` file.
- Updated the view config schema to include a coordination space, which supports coordinated multiple view functionality. The coordination space holds coordination objects, each of which has a type, a set of scopes, and a value assigned to each scope.
- Updated the view config schema to handle multiple datasets, and added a `dataset` configuration object type for coordinated multi-dataset view configs.
- Added a mapping from component type to coordination object types, streamlining the process of consuming and updating coordination object state in the `___Subscriber` components.
- Removed the unnecessary `name` field from dataset file definitions (previously a property of the `layers` objects) in the view config.
- Changed view config `layers[].type` (now `datasets[].files[].type`) values to lowercase.
- Renamed `staticLayout` to `layout` in the view config.
- Changed the title text of `LayerController` from "Layer Controller" to "Spatial Layers".
- Moved the Spatial layer initialization from `LayerControllerSubscriber` to `SpatialSubscriber`.
    - Changed the `LayerControllerSubscriber` to a "controlled" component which obtains layer state information from the `spatialLayers` coordination object.
    - Eliminated usage of randomly-generated uuids for layer and channel states.
- Changed the `Spatial` component implementation (back) to a React class component, after experiencing difficult-to-debug performance issues with the function component implementation.
- Simplified the `GenesSubscriber` implementation such that it no longer handles converting gene expression data to colors. Instead, the plot components (spatial, scatterplot, and heatmap) must look up the gene expression data and handle color conversion themselves, de-coupling them from `GenesSubscriber`.
- Added a file `src/components/data-hooks.js` containing React hook functions for initial data load (and data update subscriptions) for each data type.
    - Added error handling for data loading errors within the hook functions, which emit the `STATUS_WARN` event and subsequently call the `Vitessce` component's `onWarn` prop.
- Added a file `src/components/hooks.js` containing custom React hook functions which are un-related to dataset management (see above bullet).
    - Moved existing hook functions out of `src/components/utils.js` and into this `src/components/hooks.js` file.
- Removed the global app-level "please wait" spinner, and replaced with component-level spinners, to account for the multi-dataset support (for example if the dataset coordination object for a component changes then the component will need to obtain a different dataset, and this may occur at any time).
- Moved auto image layer initialization out of `LayerControllerSubscriber` and into `SpatialSubscriber` to allow initialization even when no `layerController` component exists.
- Removed usage of random uuid values from image layer identifiers, and instead replace with the `index` property, which refers to the index of the layer within the `raster.json` layer array.
- Switched from a local layer controller state management approach (via local reducer functions) to a global coordination object layer state management approach.
- Switched from using the property `visibility` to `visible` in image channel state to be more consistent with DeckGL layer `visible` convention.
- Moved a `range()` function call out of a "hot" loop in `src/components/heatmap/utils.js` to cache the value and prevent calling every iteration (every row and column during heatmap tile creation).
- Updated `___TooltipSubscriber` components and the `Status` component to use the `cellHighlight` and `geneHighlight` coordination object values. This allows highlight functionality to be local to a particular coordination scope (rather than global to the whole app).
- Updated the `DescriptionSubscriber` to use the image layer definitions in the `spatialLayers` coordination object.
- Refactored the `Status` and `StatusSubscriber` components to move the `TitleInfo` child component out of `Status` and into `StatusSubscriber` to be consistent with the other subscriber components.
- Separate out development from production builds.
- Only test/publish on production builds.
- Don't include dependencies in production ES build.
- Added terms and diagrams related to the coordination model to the `GLOSSARY.md` document.
- Update README screenshots.
- Use a random `uuid` when upgrading `v0.1.0` view configs to `v1.0.0` to enable the data hook `dataset` dependency to detect dataset updates resulting from passing new view configs.
- Fixed bug in `Status` component in which `cellHighlight` and `geneHighlight` were incorrectly expected to be objects.
- Fix `Spatial` initialization bug.
- Remove dead code from Rollup config in `packages/workers`.
- Remove Showcase section from `About` page now that we have a standalone Showcase documentation page.
