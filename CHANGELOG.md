## In Progress

### Added

### Changed

## [1.1.12](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.1.12) - 2021-07-20

### Added
- Attach on load callbacks and loading indicators to layer controller when using (global) selection slider.
- Added a new view config version `1.0.2` with corresponding upgrade function to fix backwards compatibility of the layer controller. The upgrade function sets the prop `globalDisable3d` for any layer controller components to keep the previous 2D-only functionality that older view configs would expect.

### Changed
- Change bitmask rendering to only display a unique pixel value instead of blending.
- Use component height for determining 3D sizing.
  - Use state rather than computing every render.
- Fix cell highlight bug with bitmask where tooltip information remains on screen after no longer highlighting.
- No selection of cells in bitmask now results in default "grey" color instead of the last selected cell set.
- Cache computation of internal data structures on `AnnData` zarr loaders.
- Upgrade zarr.js to 0.4.0
- Make getting node size efficient by using `reduce` instead of `length`.
- Fixed backwards-compatibility `spatialRasterLayers` bugs:
    - The layer `type` should not be used, since it is currently expected to be either `"raster"` or `"bitmask"`, but previously was allowed to be any string including `"t"`. Instead, need to detect whether the layer is a bitmask layer using `layerMeta.metadata.isBitmask` defined in the `raster.json` file definition.
    - The `visible` property was previously only available for channels. Now, there is a per-layer `visible` property, but old view configs may not contain this. Therefore, we need to explicitly check that the value is a boolean rather than simply falsy `undefined` or `null`.
    - Enforce `type` of `spatialRasterLayers` layer as `bitmask` or `raster`.

## [1.1.11](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.1.11) - 2021-06-25

### Added
- Global visibility button next to name in layer controller.
- Volumetric ray casting from `Viv`
    - Upgrade `Viv` to 0.10.4
    - Add new coordination types `spatialRotationX` `spatialRotationY` `spatialRotationZ` `spatialRotationOrbit` `spatialOrbitAxis` and update `spatialRasterLayers` with new parts
    - Add spatial view state coordination types to `LayerController`
    - Update UI for `LayerController`
- Global visbiility prop per layer in `spatialRasterLayers`.
- Add indication to Y axis title of cell set expression violin plot when log-transformation is active.

### Changed
- Cache cell set polygon outputs and do not calculate them unless requested.
  - Modify the cache to use an array of tuples, since using an array as an object key results in conversion to string.
- Clean up `getFlatArrDecompressed` fetching.
- Fix bitmask remove button style.
- Don't show 3D dropdown if only 2D is available.
- Don't show Volume tab (or any tabs) when 3D is not available.

## [1.1.10](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.1.10) - 2021-05-19

### Added

- Fix bug where adding/removing layers only adds a `bitmask` controller.
- Fix condition for showing lasso with bitmask and/or centroids.
- Fix 0's displaying when selection is not enabled for `Spatial`.
- Fix bug where polygons or centroids would show under the `bitmask`.
- `bitmask` color texture creation assumed that `cellColors` prop was only rgb, but it can be rgba.
- Fix bug where quadtree wouldn't work with only scatterplot.
- Fix controller padding bug.
- Ensure `VlenUtf8` filter is only used/checked when necessary.

## [1.1.9](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.1.9) - 2021-05-07

### Added
- Add opacity slider when `layerController` is closed, with label.

### Changed

- Improve violin plot performance by making `useExpressionByCellSet` faster.
- Allow for autosizing `CellSetExpressionPlot` bottom margin depending on axis labels.
- Make margin bottom of `CellSetExpressionPlot` proportional to the square root of the number of characters because the `labelAngle` is 45.

## [1.1.8](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.1.8) - 2021-03-31

- `useDevicePixels` for large datasets in `AbstractSpatialOrScatterplot`.
- Use `Array.from` instead of `new Array` for `BaseAnnDataLoader`
- Use `concaveman` instead of `@turf/concave`.
- Fix `categories` parsing for AnnData with `dtype=|O`.
- Do not do call `makeDefaultGetCellIsSelected` if not necessary.
- Upgrade `Viv` to 0.9.3.

## [1.1.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.1.4) - 2021-02-11

### Added

## [1.1.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.1.1) - 2020-12-27

### Added
- Implemented the view config API in JavaScript in a class called `VitessceConfig`.
- Add searchable genes list.
- Support loading AnnData from zarr.
- Added scatterplot component options pane.
- Added a `TextLayer` to render cell set names over the corresponding cell set centroid in the scatterplot.
- Added a gene expression histogram Vega-Lite component and a cell set by gene expression violin plot Vega component.

### Changed
- Genes list is now a virtual scroll to allow for more performant rendering.
- Fix molecules highlight reversion - hovered molecules now appear in the status component.
- Remove "Add Channel" button for RGB images.
- Lazy load HiGlass (and PIXI.js) from absolute URLs (unpkg) to avoid dynamic script import issues with relative paths after bundling.
    - When loading JS resources for HiGlass and PIXI.js, use the current environment (dev/prod) to determine `min.js` vs `js` extensions, and use `package.json` to determine package versions.
- Make ability to do cell set operations (union, intersection, complement) less restrictive
- Implemented the `genomicZoomX`, `genomicZoomY`, `genomicTargetX`, and `genomicTargetY` coordination types for coordinating the zoom and pan interactions of multiple HiGlass views.
    - Simplified the `hgViewConfig` prop so that it supports only a single HiGlass view, and then allows Vitessce to handle the HiGlass view's `initialXDomain` and `initialYDomain` properties (through the coordination space), as well as the rest of the view config.
    - Added the `genomicProfiles` component which abstracts away the HiGlass view config.

## [1.1.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.1.0) - 2020-11-17

### Added
- Built-in support for encoding and decoding compressed conf as url param.
- Add heatmap controls state to saved view config.
- Add `spatialLayers` validation to config schema.
- Add heatmap support to schema.
- `domainType` is now part of the raster spatial layers.
- `domain` is now removed from raster spatial layer channel definition schema, since channel-level domain settings could conflict with layer-level domain _type_ settings.

### Changed
- Fixed schema validity as state updates.
    - Expanded schema to allow null values which denote that these values can be auto-initialized.
        - Note that we do not want the empty array to denote anything special.
- For demos, added a `&debug=true` GET parameter option, to enable logging and validating the published view config on every change.
- Updated cell set functionality to support exporting state via view config:
    - Added the `additionalCellSets` coordination type to store user-defined cell sets
    - Added the `cellSetColor` coordination type to store mappings from cell set paths to cell set colors (for both user-defined and dataset-defined cell sets).
    - Updated the code to avoid reliance on uuid "key" variables. Instead, we want to always use the "name path": the array of strings representing the path down the hierarchy to the node.
    - Removed the distinction between "visible" sets and "selected" (i.e. checked) sets.
- Upgrade deck.gl to 8.3 and viv to 0.5
- Fix build issues with nebula.
- Use URL fragment instead of query param for `export-utils`.

- Fix bug from removing `domain` from the config schema that prevented updates when loader selection changes.
- Fix `additionalCellSets` having a tree without a version number.
- Update Viv reference

## [1.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitessce/v/1.0.0) - 2020-09-2

### Added
- Introduced a [zustand](https://github.com/react-spring/zustand) store for managing the view config:
    - coordination space
    - layout
        - component-level coordination scopes
- Introduced a provider component: `DatasetLoaderProvider`.
    - `DatasetLoaderProvider` sets up Loader objects for each file of each dataset in the view config.
    - `VitessceGrid` is a consumer of `DatasetLoaderProvider` and injects the mapping from datasets-to-loaders into the child `___Subscriber` components. This functionality replaces the `SourcePublisher` component.
        - The loading spinner was moved into a new `LoadingIndicator` component.
        - Added a new prop `isReady` for the `TitleInfo` component (parent of the `LoadingIndicator` component), so that each `___Subscriber` component can handle its own loading spinner.
- Added a required `version` property to the view config schema.
- Added the `initStrategy` property to the `v1.0.0` view config schema, where the value can be one of `"auto"` or `"none"` (and potentially other things in the future).
    - This will determine how the coordination space is initialized.
    - `"auto"` results in certain coordination types having "global" coordination (all components map to same scope) while the remaining coordination types have "independent" coordination (all components map to different scopes).
        - The `"auto"` strategy also respects any initial coordination setup, and only fills in missing values.
- Added support for both `v0.1.0` ("legacy") and `v1.0.0` (coordination model) view configs via an `upgrade()` function.
    - `v0.1.0` view configs will be validated against the `v0.1.0` schema, then upgraded, and then validated again against the `v1.0.0` schema.
- Added a unique name constraint for cell set names.
    - Because `cellSetSelection` is now a coordination type, the value must be stored in the view config. Previously, multiple cell sets were allowed to exist with the same name because cell sets were identified with a random uuid key internally. We would not want a random uuid key to "leak" into the global state or view config, and instead want to use an externally-meaningful name when identifying cell sets in the view config.
    - Due to this constraint, the automatic naming for cell selections as `"Current selection"` (or `"Current union"`, `"Current intersection"`, `"Current complement"`) have been changed to `"Selection {i}"` (or `"Union {i}"`, `"Intersection {i}"`, `"Complement {i}"`) where `{i}` is the next integer that does not cause a conflict.
- Added the optional `onConfigChange` and `onLoaderChange` callback props to the `Vitessce` component.
    - These allow a consumer app to be notified of all view config (and by extension coordination object) updates.

### Changed
- Update README screenshots.
- Fixed bug in `Status` component in which `cellHighlight` and `geneHighlight` were incorrectly expected to be objects.
- Moved the `Vitessce` component out of `src/app/app.js` into `src/app/Vitessce.js`.
- Moved the `Warning` component out of `src/app/app.js` into `src/app/Warning.js`.
- Renamed `VitessceGrid` to `VitessceGridLayout`.
- Renamed `PubSubVitessceGrid` to `VitessceGrid`.
- Moved utility functions that are common to both `src/components/` and `src/app/` to a new `src/utils.js` file.
- Updated the view config schema to include a coordination space, which supports coordinated multiple view functionality. The coordination space holds coordination objects, each of which has a type, a set of scopes, and a value assigned to each scope.
- Updated the view config schema to handle multiple datasets, and added a `dataset` configuration object type for coordinated multi-dataset view configs.
- Added a mapping from component type to coordination object types, streamlining the process of consuming and updating coordination object state in the `___Subscriber` components.
- Removed the unnecessary `name` field from dataset file definitions (previously a property of the `layers` objects) in the view config.
- Changed view config `layers[].type` (now `datasets[].files[].type`) values to lowercase.
- Renamed `staticLayout` to `layout` in the view config.
- Changed the title text of `LayerController` from "Layer Controller" to "Spatial Layers".
- Moved the Spatial layer initialization from `LayerControllerSubscriber` to `SpatialSubscriber`.
    - Changed the `LayerControllerSubscriber` to a "controlled" component which obtains layer state information from the `spatialLayers` coordination object.
    - Eliminated usage of randomly-generated uuids for layer and channel states.
- Changed the `Spatial` component implementation (back) to a React class component, after experiencing difficult-to-debug performance issues with the function component implementation.
- Simplified the `GenesSubscriber` implementation such that it no longer handles converting gene expression data to colors. Instead, the plot components (spatial, scatterplot, and heatmap) must look up the gene expression data and handle color conversion themselves, de-coupling them from `GenesSubscriber`.
- Added a file `src/components/data-hooks.js` containing React hook functions for initial data load (and data update subscriptions) for each data type.
    - Added error handling for data loading errors within the hook functions, which emit the `STATUS_WARN` event and subsequently call the `Vitessce` component's `onWarn` prop.
- Added a file `src/components/hooks.js` containing custom React hook functions which are un-related to dataset management (see above bullet).
    - Moved existing hook functions out of `src/components/utils.js` and into this `src/components/hooks.js` file.
- Removed the global app-level "please wait" spinner, and replaced with component-level spinners, to account for the multi-dataset support (for example if the dataset coordination object for a component changes then the component will need to obtain a different dataset, and this may occur at any time).
- Moved auto image layer initialization out of `LayerControllerSubscriber` and into `SpatialSubscriber` to allow initialization even when no `layerController` component exists.
- Removed usage of random uuid values from image layer identifiers, and instead replace with the `index` property, which refers to the index of the layer within the `raster.json` layer array.
- Switched from a local layer controller state management approach (via local reducer functions) to a global coordination object layer state management approach.
- Switched from using the property `visibility` to `visible` in image channel state to be more consistent with DeckGL layer `visible` convention.
- Moved a `range()` function call out of a "hot" loop in `src/components/heatmap/utils.js` to cache the value and prevent calling every iteration (every row and column during heatmap tile creation).
- Updated `___TooltipSubscriber` components and the `Status` component to use the `cellHighlight` and `geneHighlight` coordination object values. This allows highlight functionality to be local to a particular coordination scope (rather than global to the whole app).
- Updated the `DescriptionSubscriber` to use the image layer definitions in the `spatialLayers` coordination object.
- Refactored the `Status` and `StatusSubscriber` components to move the `TitleInfo` child component out of `Status` and into `StatusSubscriber` to be consistent with the other subscriber components.
- Separate out development from production builds.
- Only test/publish on production builds.
- Don't include dependencies in production ES build.
- Added terms and diagrams related to the coordination model to the `GLOSSARY.md` document.
- Update README screenshots.
- Use a random `uuid` when upgrading `v0.1.0` view configs to `v1.0.0` to enable the data hook `dataset` dependency to detect dataset updates resulting from passing new view configs.
- Fixed bug in `Status` component in which `cellHighlight` and `geneHighlight` were incorrectly expected to be objects.
- Fix `Spatial` initialization bug.
