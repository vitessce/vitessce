Vitessce is a framework for integrative visualization of multi-modal and spatially-resolved single-cell data. Its modular design is optimized for scalable, linked visualizations that support the spatial and non-spatial representation of tissue-, cell- and molecule-level data. Vitessce integrates the [Viv](http://viv.gehlenborglab.org/) library to visualize highly multiplexed, high-resolution, high-bit depth image data directly from OME-TIFF files and Bio-Formats-compatible Zarr stores.


We currently support the following ways of using Vitessce:

- Configure Vitessce using the [online editor](/#?edit=true).
- Load a view configuration from a [URL or JSON file](/#?edit=true).
- Embed Vitessce as a [React component](/docs/js-overview/) in a React app.
- Use Vitessce in a [Jupyter Notebook](/docs/platforms/#python-jupyter-widget) via the Python Package
- Use Vitessce in [RStudio](http://localhost:3001/docs/platforms/#r-htmlwidget) via the R Package
- Use Vitessce as a widget in an [R Shiny app](http://localhost:3001/docs/platforms/#r-htmlwidget) via the R Package

The [Platforms](/docs/platforms/) page contains more information about these options.
