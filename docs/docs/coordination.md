Vitessce supports *coordinated multiple views*, meaning that visualizations can be linked together on many properties.
The implementation of coordinated multiple views in Vitessce follows a coordination model proposed by Boukhelifa and Rodgers ([Information Visualization 2003](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/13874/1/cmvev.pdf)).

## Graph Representation

The coordination model can be represented as a graph in which there are three types of nodes: coordination types, coordination scopes, and views.

## Glossary

The following terms have been adapted from the information visualization literature and are used throughout the Vitessce documentation.

### Coordination Model
The approach or architecture used to achieve view coordination ([Roberts 2007](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/14569/1/Coordinated_%26_Multiple.pdf)).

### Coordination Type
The property or parameter being coordinated, such as "spatial rotation" or "heatmap zoom" or "gene expression colormap". Vitessce further requires that coordination type values conform to a JSON schema, for instance a primitive number or a more complex array or object schema. The [Coordination Types](/docs/coordination-types/) page lists all coordinate-able properties.

### Coordination Scope
A named instance of a coordination type. Each `(coordination type, view)` tuple may map onto a different coordination scope. Views are "coordinated" if they are linked to a common coordination scope. Views may update their `(coordination type, coordination scope)` tuples if changes to the coordinated view connections are initiated by the user.

### Coordination Value
The value of a given coordination scope at a given time.

### Coordination Object
The container for a particular coordination type and its associated coordination scopes & values. Each coordination type has one coordination object.

### Coordination Space
The container for all coordination objects in a visualization system.
In Vitessce, the coordination space is stored in the view config in a serializable JSON format.

### Translation Function
A function that translates values between the coordination space and a visualization implementation.
Coordination values may be stored in an abstract format rather than the format required for any particular view. For this reason, coordinated views must define a translation function for each coordination type, which maps coordination values onto the native format used by the view. In the simplest case the identity function may be used.
