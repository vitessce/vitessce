Vitessce supports several **data types** ([`datasets[].files[].type`](/docs/view-config-json/#files) in the JSON-based view config) which denote in an abstract sense the type of observations contained in a file. For each data type, Vitessce may support multiple **file types** ([`datasets[].files[].fileType`](/docs/view-config-json/#files)) which denote specific schemas and file formats that Vitessce knows how to read.


For example, a file that conforms to the `cells` data type may contain embedding (e.g. UMAP and PCA) coordinates for each cell. But depending on which file format is more convenient, you may opt to use the `cells.json` or `anndata-cells.zarr` file type.
