Vitessce supports several **data types** which denote in an abstract sense the type of observations contained in a file (e.g., matrix, dataframe, image).
For each data type, Vitessce may support multiple **file types** ([`datasets[].files[].fileType`](/docs/view-config-json/#files)) which denote specific schemas and file formats that Vitessce knows how to read.


For example, a file that conforms to the `obsEmbedding` data type would contain embedding coordinates for each cell (assuming each observation is a cell) e.g., computed via t-SNE or UMAP.
Depending on which file format is more convenient, you may opt to use one of many file types that correspond to the data type, such as `obsEmbedding.anndata.zarr`.

## Joint File Types

A joint file type is a pseudo-file type (pseudo in that it does not correspond to any one data type) which allows a single file definition
(and therefore a single URL) in the Vitessce configuration
to define multiple files of the atomic types listed in the table above.

This is motivated by the fact that one file may store information corresponding to _more than one_ data type.
For instance, AnnData files may store not only the obs-by-feature matrix (`adata.X`)
but also multiple 2D embedding coordinates (`adata.obsm['X_umap']` and `adata.obsm['X_pca']`),
spatial coordinates (`adata.obsm['X_spatial']`),
and cell type annotations (e.g., `adata.obs['cell_type']`).
Rather than defining five different files
(corresponding to the atomic file types `obsFeatureMatrix.anndata.zarr`, `obsEmbedding.anndata.zarr`,
`obsEmbedding.anndata.zarr`, `obsLocations.anndata.zarr`, and `obsSets.anndata.zarr`, respectively),
one `anndata.zarr` joint file definition can be used instead.
