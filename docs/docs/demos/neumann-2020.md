### Description

Multimodal molecular imaging data collected from the Left Kidney of a 58 year old Black or African American Male donor by the Biomolecular Multimodal Imaging Center (BIOMC) at Vanderbilt University. BIOMIC is a Tissue Mapping Center that is part of the NIH funded Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP). Datasets generated by BIOMIC combine MALDI imaging mass spectrometry with various microscopy modalities including autoflourescence and stained microscopy. Support was provided by the NIH Common Fund and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (U54 DK120058). Tissue was collected through the Cooperative Human Tissue Network with support provided by the NIH National Cancer Institute (5 UM1 CA183727-08).
