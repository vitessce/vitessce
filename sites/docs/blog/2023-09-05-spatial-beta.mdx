The next generation of spatial and layerController views in Vitessce is ready for testing.
There are several motivations for re-implementing these views:

<!--truncate-->

- Support a more flexible coordination model
- Support multi-channel segmentation bitmasks
- Support per-[obsType](../obs-by-feature-update/) segmentation bitmasks
- Use semantically-meaningful data types for points and spots
- Unify the visualization properties for polygon and bitmask segmentations

These views are available as `spatialBeta` and `layerControllerBeta`.
Note: automatic initialization of the coordination space is not yet supported, so usage will require some manual initialization.
We suggest using the object-oriented `VitessceConfig` API (specifically `VitessceConfig.linkViewsByObject`).

## Flexible coordination model

Previously, the spatial view used two coordination types `spatialSegmentationLayer` and `spatialImageLayer` which required an array of nested objects as values.
Usage of nested objects as coordination values prevents coordination of a subset of those values.
For example, this prevented coordination of channel colors while referencing different channel indices or vice-versa.

In contrast, `spatialBeta` and `layerControllerBeta` use multi-level- and meta- coordination.

## obsPoints and obsSpots data types

## Unified visualization properties for segmentations
