The Vitessce __view config__ defines datasets (and the URLs to their associated data files) and views that will be used to visualize and interact with the data.
The view config also stores the [coordination space](/docs/coordination/) (i.e., the state of the views) and defines which views and properties are coordinated.

We realise that having to construct a view config adds friction, for instance preventing quick visualization of an image or AnnData object. This is why for some file formats, Vitessce can generate a valid view config, using URLs to your datasets (see [Data Preparation](/docs/#data-preparation)). For more information, see the [automatic configuration](/docs/default-config-json/) page.

## Required properties

:::note

The full view config JSON schema can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessce/vitessce/tree/main/src/schemas/).

:::

### `name`
- Type: `string`

A name for the view config. Although this field is required, you are welcome to use the empty string.

### `version`

- Type: `string`

The view config schema version. The documentation pages here are based on the latest version.

|Value|Notes|
|-------|-----|
| `1.0.0`| Support for the coordination space was added in this version. |

| `1.0.14`| Adds the coordination types `gatingFeatureSelectionX`, `gatingFeatureSelectionY`, and `featureValueTransformCoefficient`. |
| `1.0.15`| View type names were changed in this version to move towards support for feature-observation matrices (FOM). |
| `1.0.16` | Support for `coordinationScopesBy` for multiple per-coordination-type coordination scopes. |
| `1.0.17` | Update `obsSets.anndata.zarr` config options schema (previously array) to be an object like `{ obsSets: [/* ... */] }`. |

<!--<BrowserOnlyDiffViewConfigSchema />-->

### `initStrategy`
- Type: `string`

The coordination space initialization strategy. The initialization strategy determines how missing coordination objects and coordination scope mappings are initially filled in.

|Value|Notes|
|-------|-----|
| `auto`| Recommended. This strategy will allow you to omit some or all coordination scope mappings. |
| `none`| Use this strategy if you would like to define all coordination scope mappings yourself. |

:::note
If you find yourself following certain patterns when initializing coordination spaces manually, please let us know so that we may work with you to implement this pattern as a supported strategy.

### `datasets`
- Type: `object[]`

The datasets array stores a list of dataset objects. Each dataset object must contain a unique ID `uid`, a list of file objects `files`, and an optional `name`.

#### `uid`
- Type: `string`

A unique ID for the dataset. Required.

#### `name`
- Type: `string`

A human-readable name for the dataset. Optional.

#### `files`
- Type: `object[]`

The files array stores a list of file objects for a dataset. File objects must contain a `fileType`. All file types require a `url` string (with the exception of [`image.raster.json`](/docs/data-file-types/#imagerasterjson) and [`obsSegmentations.raster.json`](/docs/data-file-types/#obssegmentationsrasterjson)). We don't associate any semantics with URL strings.

For more information about data types and file types, please visit our [Data Types and File Types](/docs/data-types-file-types/) documentation page.

```json
...,
"datasets": [
    {
        "uid": "my-dataset",
        "name": "My amazing dataset",
        "files": [
            {
                "fileType": "obsEmbedding.csv",
                "url": "http://example.com/umap.csv",
                "coordinationValues": {
                    "obsType": "cell",
                    "embeddingType": "UMAP"
                },
                "options": {
                    ...
                }
            },
            {
                "fileType": "obsEmbedding.csv",
                "url": "http://example.com/pca.csv",
                "coordinationValues": {
                    "obsType": "cell",
                    "embeddingType": "PCA"
                },
                "options": {
                    ...
                }
            },
            {
                "fileType": "image.ome-zarr",
                "url": "http://example.com/my_image.zarr"
            }
        ]
    }
],
...
```

### `layout`
- Type: `object[]`

The layout property defines which visualization (and controller) components will be rendered, how they will be arranged on the screen, and optionally how they will map onto coordination scopes. Each layout object represents one "component" or "view", and must contain a component name `component`, width `w` and height `h`, and horizontal position `x` and vertical position `y`. Components are arranged in a grid with 12 columns and a dynamic number of rows. Optionally, each component may contain the properties `uid`, `coordinationScopes`, and `props`.

For more information about the available view types and coordination types, please visit the [View Types](/docs/components/) and [Coordination Types](/docs/coordination-types/) documentation pages.
```json
...,
"layout": [
    {
        "component": "scatterplot",
        "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 6, "h": 12,
        "coordinationScopes": {
            "dataset": "D1",
            "embeddingZoom": "EZ1",
            "embeddingType": "ET1"
        }
    },
    {
        "component": "scatterplot",
        "x": 6, "y": 0, "w": 6, "h": 12,
        "coordinationScopes": {
            "dataset": "D1",
            "embeddingZoom": "EZ2",
            "embeddingType": "ET2"
        }
    }
],
...
```

## Optional properties

### `coordinationSpace`
- Type: `object`

The [coordination space](/docs/coordination/#coordination-space) stores the values associated with each [coordination object](/docs/coordination/#coordination-object). It may be helpful to recall that the coordination **space** is analogous to computer memory which stores values of variables, and the coordination **scope names** are analogous to references to different locations in memory.

The keys of each object (at the first level) in the coordination space represent [coordination types](/docs/coordination/#coordination-type). The keys of each coordination type object represent [coordination scope](/docs/coordination/#coordination-scope) names. The types of values that each coordination scope can take can be as simple as a single number or as complex as an array or object, and depend on the types of values supported by its coordination type.

```json
...,
"coordinationSpace": {
    "dataset": {
        "D1": "my-dataset"
    },
    "embeddingZoom": {
        "EZ1": 2,
        "EZ2": 20
    },
    "embeddingType": {
        "ET1": "UMAP",
        "ET2": "PCA"
    }
},
...
```

When the coordination space is entirely or partially omitted from the view config, `initStrategy` determines how the missing parts will be initialized.

### `description`
- Type: `string`

An optional description for the view config.


### `uid`
- Type: `string`

A unique ID for the config. Optional.


Intended to be used in situations where `<Vitessce/>` is used as a [controlled component](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components)
(i.e., a parent component is the source of truth for the `config` prop and likely also uses the `onConfigChange` prop).
For example, if a change in `config.uid` is detected, the configuration will be re-validated (which might not occur on other changes to `config` for performance reasons). 


Note that this `config.uid` property has a different function from the `uid` prop on the `<Vitessce/>` component.


:::tip

Vitessce uses a JSON-based view configuration internally.
However, we provide language-specific object-oriented view config APIs as alternative ways to construct configurations:
- [JavaScript View Config API](/docs/view-config-js/)
- [Python View Config API](https://python-docs.vitessce.io/api_config.html)
- [R View Config API](https://r-docs.vitessce.io/reference/VitessceConfig.html#examples)
