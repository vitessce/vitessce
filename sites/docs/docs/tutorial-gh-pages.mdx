This tutorial covers how to embed Vitessce as a React component in a website that can be deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (GitHub's free static website hosting service).

## NodeJS and NPM environment setup

Be sure to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/).

This tutorial was written using the following versions of NodeJS and NPM:
```sh
node --version
```

v23.6.0


```sh
npm --version
```

10.9.2

## React app setup

Use [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) to initialize a new React project:

```sh
npm create vite@latest vitessce-demo-gh-pages -- --template react
cd vitessce-demo-gh-pages
npm install
npm install react@18.0.0 react-dom@18.0.0 
npm run dev
# Press Ctrl-C to stop the development server.
```
Notes: React version 18 is compatible with Vitessce. At the time of writing, the latest version of Vite is `6.3.5`.

Initialize the new React app directory as a Git repository:

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
```

## Repo setup
Create a new GitHub repository (https://github.com/new) (here I called the repository `vitessce-demo-gh-pages`) and set it as the remote origin:

```sh
# Replace my-username with your GitHub username in the following line:
git remote add origin git@github.com:my-username/vitessce-demo-gh-pages.git
git push -u origin main

```
### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error in pushing to the main branch, try the following and commit the changes in the editor:
```sh
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories --no-rebase

```
## Install Vitessce
Install the Vitessce NPM package to be able to use the React component in the app:

```sh
# from within the `vitessce-demo-gh-pages` directory
npm install vitessce --save
```


## React app development

Make a new file `src/my-view-config.js`:

```js
export const myViewConfig = {
  version: "1.0.17",
  name: "Habib et al., 2017 Nature Methods",
  description: "Archived frozen adult human post-mortem brain tissue profiled by snRNA-seq (DroNc-seq)",
  datasets: [
    {
      uid: "habib-2017",
      name: "Habib 2017",
      files: [
        {
          fileType: "anndata.zarr",
          url: "https://storage.googleapis.com/vitessce-demo-data/habib-2017/habib17.processed.h5ad.zarr",
          coordinationValues: {
            embeddingType: "UMAP",
          },
          options: {
            obsFeatureMatrix: {
              path: "X",
              initialFeatureFilterPath: "var/top_highly_variable",
            },
            obsEmbedding: {
              path: "obsm/X_umap",
            },
            obsSets: [
              {
                name: "Cell Type",
                path: "obs/CellType",
              },
            ],
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  initStrategy: "auto",
  coordinationSpace: {
    embeddingType: {
      UMAP: "UMAP",
    },
    featureValueColormapRange: {
      A: [0, 0.35],
    },
  },
  layout: [
    {
      component: "obsSets",
      h: 4, w: 4, x: 4, y: 0,
    },
    {
      component: "obsSetSizes",
      h: 4, w: 4, x: 8, y: 0,
    },
    {
      component: "scatterplot",
      h: 4, w: 4, x: 0, y: 0,
      coordinationScopes: {
        embeddingType: "UMAP",
        featureValueColormapRange: "A",
      },
    },
    {
      component: "heatmap",
      h: 4, w: 8, x: 0, y: 4,
      coordinationScopes: {
        featureValueColormapRange: "A",
      },
      props: {
        transpose: true,
      },
    },
    {
      component: "featureList",
      h: 4, w: 2, x: 8, y: 4,
    },
    {
      component: "description",
      h: 4, w: 2, x: 10, y: 4,
    },
  ],
};
```

In `src/App.jsx`:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Vitessce } from 'vitessce';
import { myViewConfig } from './my-view-config.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Vitessce
      config={myViewConfig}
      theme="light"
    />
  );
}
```

For more information about the React component, see the [documentation page](../js-react-vitessce/).

In `src/index.css` (which is imported by `src/main.jsx`):

```css
html {
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 'Oxygen',
    'Ubuntu', 'Cantarell', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue',
    sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  flex: 1;
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
}

.vitessce-container {
  height: max(100%, 100vh);
  width: 100%;
}
```

### Configure Vite project
Edit the `vite.config.js` file to allow Vite to serve correctly from a subpath like `https://my-username.github.io/vitessce-demo-gh-pages/`
```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/vitessce-demo-gh-pages/',
})
```

### Run app locally

To try out the app locally, run the following in the terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite development server, which should auto-reload the web application upon code changes.


## Data deployment

When you deploy the React app to the internet via GitHub Pages, the data URLs referenced in your Vitessce configuration (defined in `src/my-view-config.js`) must point to static files that are hosted remotely on the internet.
AWS S3 is one example of a static file hosting service (in this case, an object storage system) that can be configured such that other websites (e.g., GitHub Pages sites) can load its hosted files.

If you are using AWS S3 to host the data that is referenced in your Vitessce configuration, ensure that the S3 bucket is configured according to our [AWS S3 data hosting](/docs/data-hosting/#aws-s3) documentation.


## GitHub Pages deployment

To deploy a website to GitHub pages one time, the [`gh-pages`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages#command-line-utility) package can be installed from NPM and run as a command line utility.
However, in this tutorial we will describe how to use a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) which will automatically re-deploy the React app to the GitHub Pages website upon each push to the main branch of its GitHub repository.

Create a new file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following contents:

```yml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main


permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    name: Build React app and deploy to GitHub Pages
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 23.6.0
      - name: Install NPM dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build React app
        run: npm run build
      - name: Upload build artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: dist
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    needs: build
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
    
```



### Allow GitHub Pages to be deployed from GitHub Actions

To allow the GitHub Action to modify the `gh-pages` branch of the repository, we need to update the settings at `https://github.com/{my-username}/vitessce-demo-gh-pages/settings/pages` (or navigate to `Settings` -> `Pages` for the repo).

Under Build and deployment, select `GitHub Actions` in the Source dropdown menu.


### Set the homepage property in package.json

In order for relative file paths to be [resolved correctly](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment#building-for-relative-paths), specify the GitHub pages URL as the website's homepage.

In `package.json` (replacing `my-username` with your GitHub username):

```json
  ...,
  "homepage": "https://my-username.github.io/vitessce-demo-gh-pages/",
  ...,
```


### Commit and push to GitHub

The changes to the Git repository will need to be committed and pushed to GitHub in order for the GitHub Action to be executed and the GitHub Pages site to be subsequently deployed.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Second commit"
git push
```

## Test the deployment

Check that the GitHub Action has executed successfully in the "Actions" tab of the GitHub page for the repository.
Then, go to the GitHub Pages URL to load the website (replacing `my-username` with your GitHub username):

https://my-username.github.io/vitessce-demo-gh-pages/

## Complete example

For reference, a complete example can be found in the [`vitessce-demo-gh-pages`](https://github.com/vitessce/vitessce-demo-gh-pages) GitHub repository
with corresponding deployment at https://vitessce.github.io/vitessce-demo-gh-pages/.
