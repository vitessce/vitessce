This directory is a temporary workaround until the next version of HiGlass is released which includes https://github.com/higlass/higlass/pull/1111, which removed the github dependencies from the HiGlass `package.json`. At that point we should be able to replace the current dynamic import with `import('higlass')` and add `higlass` to the `package.json` in Vitessce (at `packages/view-types/genomic-profiles/package.json`).
