# Comparative sub-package

This folder contains a sub-package which:
- re-exports all of the entries from `vitessce` (i.e., the exports of the subpackage located in `packages/main/prod`)
- plus, exports controlled and un-controlled variants of a component that wraps `<Vitessce/>` for comparative analysis.
