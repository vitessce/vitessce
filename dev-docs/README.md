# Developer documentation

The developer documentation here is meant for usage by the internal development team, external contributors, and plugin developers.

## For plugin developers

- [View type implementation](./plugin-view-types.md)
- [File type implementation](./plugin-file-types.md)

## For internal developers

We not only want to document implementation details, but also higher-level architectural details and development processes.
However, documentation that would be relevant to a wider audience than noted above should instead be included in the main documentation website that is hosted at http://vitessce.io.

### Architecture

The diagram below highlights how Vitessce is composed of a top-level `<Vitessce/>` React component which encapsulates several individual visualization or control views such as `<Scatterplot/>` and `<Spatial/>`.
